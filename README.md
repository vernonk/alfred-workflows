Alfred Workflows
---

This repo is to hold workflows that I find or put together for Alfred v2. I'm going to also try to keep a running description of what each workflow is and what it does. Love to hear if you know of any awesome workflows.

## Chrome Canary to Evernote

I often have tons of tabs open (like lots of others) that are related to what I'm researching at the time. But what if I need to change topics? That's easy... open a new tab. This workflow makes it a simple keystroke to create a new Evernote note using the open tabs from the front window.
